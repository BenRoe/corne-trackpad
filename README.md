# Trackpad in a Keycap for Corne/CrKbd Keyboard

This is a Trackpad add-on for the [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) keyboard.

This add-on consists of two main parts:
- an adapter PCB that goes between Elite-C and the main keyboard
- a connector PCB that links trackpad with the adapter

Schematics and PCB design included in this repository.
[Trackpad.c](https://github.com/vlukash/qmk_firmware/blob/master/keyboards/crkbd/keymaps/vlukash_trackpad/trackpad.c) reads the trackpad data and sends it to QMK.
